title: Consent Decision Making
---


* Consent is the absence of objections
    * everyone affected by a decision can "live with it"
    * consent is not consensus with unanimity
* Consent is used to make and evolve all agreements in a circle
* Objections stop proposals becoming agreements
* Withholding objections could harm the aims of a group or organization
* Being able to raise objections at any time means that proposals only need to be *good enough for now, safe enough to try*
* Every agreement has a review date 


Consent Decision Making...

* is a facilitated decision making process
* deliberately harvests reasoned objections in order to integrate the wisdom they contain in proposals or existing agreements
* helps balance equivalence and effectiveness
* experienced groups can move quickly through the stages of Consent Decision Making
